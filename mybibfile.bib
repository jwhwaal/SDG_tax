@article{Whait2018,
abstract = {This paper uses extant academic literature to examine the relationship between tax aggressiveness and corporate social responsibility. Tax aggressiveness and corporate social responsibility have been long standing research issues each with significant ethical dimensions and implications embedded in distinct bodies of academic literature. Discussion regarding the nature and extent of the relationship between tax aggressiveness and corporate social responsibility emerged about fifteen years ago with perspectives offered from different disciplines using a variety of methodologies and theoretical perspectives. Despite this literature, the relationship between tax aggressiveness and corporate social responsibility remains contentious. An integrative literature review was employed to identify and discuss the main themes in the literature and suggest directions for future research. Results of the review revealed four main themes: the nature and purpose of taxation, empirical research, normative views, and theoretical perspectives. Implications for future research were drawn from the literature to encourage targeted development of knowledge about the relationship.},

@article{Lanis2015,
abstract = {This study examines whether corporate social responsibility performance is associated with corporate tax avoidance. Employing a matched sample of 434 firm-year observations (i.e., 217 tax-avoidant and 217 non-tax-avoidant firm-year observations) from the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini database over the period 2003-2009, our logit regression results show that the higher the level of CSR performance of a firm, the lower the likelihood of tax avoidance. Our results indicate that more socially responsible firms are likely to display less tax avoidance. Finally, the results from our additional analysis show that the CSR categories community relations and diversity represent particularly important elements of CSR performance that reduce tax avoidance.

@article{Jones2017b,
abstract = {Corporate tax aggressiveness (or avoidance) is widely viewed as socially irresponsible and "unethical" (Hoi et al 2013; Sikka 2010). However, few corporate social responsibility (CSR) studies have considered tax aggressiveness as an explicit component/measure for understanding CSR activity. Based on US data, Hoi et al (2013) find some evidence that firms with excessive irresponsible CSR activities are more aggressive in avoiding taxes. However, they find no evidence of a more general relationship between CSR and tax avoidance. This finding contrasts with the Australian study of Lanis and Richardson (2012), which documents a strong negative relationship between CSR disclosure levels and tax aggressiveness (high CSR disclosure is associated with lower tax aggressiveness). Our study extends the literature by examining the CSR-tax avoidance relationship in a wider international context using sustainability ratings data provided by Ethical Investment Research Services. Based on a large sample of firms across several international reporting jurisdictions, we find some limited evidence of a negative relationship between CSR levels and tax aggressiveness, even after controlling for firm size, industry, region, risk, financial performance and other factors. However, the association is not consistent across all tax avoidance proxies tested nor CSR metrics utilised in this study. Furthermore, when we partition the regression analysis by region, the CSR-tax avoidance relationship was found to be significant on the Asian (including Oceania) sub-sample, but is largely insignificant on the North American, European and UK sub-samples.
